I am creating my first trading algorithm with the help of various tutorials.

The goal is to build a bot that does the following,
  -Searches for financial statements
  -Calculates key values
  -Gathers the top financial statements according to the values
  -Looks at quantative data
  -Makes purchase suggestions with regard to the key values and quantative data
